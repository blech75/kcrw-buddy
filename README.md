## TODO

 * link to stores / google search

 * bigger album art images

 * MOAR METADATA!!!! (via other APIs)

 * style announcements differently. ex:
    * "E24 Text - #4 - Chris Muckley"
    * "E24 Text - #1 - Garth Trinidad"
    * "Break" in all fields

 * style KCRW special tracks differently (ex: "Live on KCRW")

 * style whitelabel tracks differently

 * add links to KCRW site, etc.

 * better design / prettier

 * mobile friendly

 * convert into dashboard widget (hopefully same codebase?)

 * previous songs w/ navigation

 * saved songs (i have a bigger idea here)

 * better error handling (ajax errors, timeouts, parsing, etc.)

 * fix encoding problems (this exists on KCRW's site, too)
   * Vals FÝr Anna --> Vals För Anna
   * La Pistola y el CorazÝn --> La Pistola y el Corazón

 * filter out "disc x of y" from query (and possibly display?)
   * ex: "Sign 'O' the Times Disc 2 of 2"

 * filter out "EP" from query/display
   * ex: "Sleep in the Water EP"

 * filter out "advance" in album name (or treat it differently)

 * filter out anything in square brackets
   * also account for starting square bracket, but no ending bracket
